# Analyzing and Mitigating Linux Boot Process Attacks

## Introduction

The boot process is a critical phase in a Linux system's operation, and any compromise during this stage can lead to severe security breaches. Advanced knowledge of the Linux boot process and potential attack vectors is essential for cybersecurity professionals. This lab will guide you through analyzing and mitigating attacks on the Linux boot process, including understanding bootloaders, kernel parameters, and early user space.

## Pre-requisites

- Advanced knowledge of Linux system administration
- Understanding of the Linux boot process
- Familiarity with GRUB and kernel parameters
- Proficiency with Linux command-line interface

## Lab Set-up and Tools

- A computer running a Linux distribution (preferably with GRUB as the bootloader)
- Root access to the Linux system
- Internet connection for downloading necessary packages
- A USB drive or virtual machine for testing (recommended for safety)

### Installing Necessary Tools

1. Update your package list:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
2. Install necessary tools:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install grub2 efibootmgr
    ```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Understanding the Boot Process

**Objective**: Gain a deep understanding of the Linux boot process, including BIOS/UEFI, bootloader, kernel, and init system.

1. Reboot your system and access the BIOS/UEFI firmware settings (usually by pressing a key like `F2` or `Delete` during boot).
2. Explore the boot options and note the boot sequence.
3. Boot into your Linux system and examine the GRUB configuration file:
    ```bash
    cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    ```
4. Review the kernel boot parameters:
    ```bash
    cat /proc/cmdline
    ```

**Expected Output**: Detailed understanding of the BIOS/UEFI settings, GRUB configuration, and kernel parameters.

### Exercise 2: Simulating a GRUB Attack

**Objective**: Simulate and analyze a GRUB configuration attack.

1. Back up your current GRUB configuration file:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.bak
    ```
2. Modify the GRUB configuration to introduce a vulnerability:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom
    ```
    Add a new menu entry with insecure settings:
    ```plaintext
    menuentry 'Insecure Entry' {
        set root='hd0,msdos1'
        linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet
        initrd /initrd.img
    }
    ```
3. Update GRUB and reboot:
    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot
    ```
4. Attempt to boot using the insecure entry and document the results.

**Expected Output**: Insight into how modifications to the GRUB configuration can impact system security.

### Exercise 3: Securing GRUB with Password Protection

**Objective**: Implement password protection for GRUB to prevent unauthorized modifications.

1. Generate a hashed password for GRUB:
    ```bash
    sudo grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
    ```
    Enter a password when prompted and note the generated hash.
2. Edit the GRUB configuration file to add the hashed password:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom
    ```
    Add the following lines:
    ```plaintext
    set superusers="root"
    password_pbkdf2 root <hash>
    ```
3. Update GRUB and reboot:
    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot
    ```
4. Test the password protection by attempting to edit GRUB entries during boot.

**Expected Output**: A secure GRUB configuration that requires a password for modifications.

### Exercise 4: Analyzing Kernel Parameter Attacks

**Objective**: Understand and mitigate attacks involving malicious kernel parameters.

1. Review the current kernel parameters:
    ```bash
    cat /proc/cmdline
    ```
2. Simulate an attack by modifying the GRUB configuration to include a malicious kernel parameter:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    ```
    Modify the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line to include an insecure parameter:
    ```plaintext
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="init=/bin/bash"
    ```
3. Update GRUB and reboot:
    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot
    ```
4. Observe the impact of the malicious parameter and how it compromises the system.

**Expected Output**: Understanding of the risks associated with kernel parameter modifications and how to identify them.

### Exercise 5: Mitigating Early User Space Attacks

**Objective**: Analyze and mitigate attacks targeting the early user space (initramfs/initrd).

1. Back up the current initramfs:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r).bak
    ```
2. Unpack the initramfs for analysis:
    ```bash
    mkdir /tmp/initrd
    cd /tmp/initrd
    sudo gzip -dc /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) | sudo cpio -idmv
    ```
3. Modify a script within the initramfs to simulate an attack:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /tmp/initrd/init
    ```
    Add a malicious command, such as:
    ```bash
    touch /tmp/malicious-activity
    ```
4. Repack the initramfs and update GRUB:
    ```bash
    sudo find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9 > /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r)
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot
    ```
5. Verify the presence of the malicious activity file after reboot.

**Expected Output**: Experience in unpacking, modifying, and repacking initramfs, and understanding the security implications.
